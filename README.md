# Accessibility Specifications

It can be hard to track down correct and up to date information on how to make
a UI accessible. So I decided to create a repository of information to help me
and anyone else looking for this type of information.

It covers things like:

- What [WAI-ARIA](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria.php) to apply.
- What keyboard functionality to apply.
- Markup and in some cases CSS code examples.
- What should happen when JavaScript is disabled.
- Examples where available.

And will include components such as:

- [Accordion](components/accordion/README.md)
- Autocomplete
- Carousel
- Datepicker
- Modal
- Tabs
- Tree

*This is a living document* and feel free to create
[issues](https://github.com/chris-pearce/accessibility-specs/issues) for any
new additions or improvements, log any issues, or just ask a question, and
label appropriately. Or create a
[Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

## Contents

- [Components](components)
  - [Accordion](components/accordion/README.md)

## Noteworthy
